After 1 year trying to understand why the business was not so successfull in the UK they hired me as a data scientist to try to find where the problem was.</p>\n<p>After data analysis on their database we came to a conclusion that the business was relying too much on visitors from other countries, other than locals, it was a problem as we don't have domain over how many tourists will come to our country. With the coronavirus pandemic, they decided to close for good.</p>\n\n<h3>A new Beginning</h3>\n<p>We had a meeting with the stakeholders and I proposed to them that with machine learning I could find the best location for a new restaurant with scientific evidences that would help it work out for the business. Some of the key points we aggreed an ideal location should have are:</p>\n<ol>\n    <li>As many car parkings as possible</li>\n    <li>Many other business around, as they would attract people to come near the restaurant.</li>\n    <li>Not too much other burger joints, but at least some to have some competition</li>\n    <li>As many business offices as possible around</li>\n</ol>"
